# [**Hands Down**](http://handsdownlayout.com) on Tern
Based on Moutis's adapted ZMK take on [**Hands Down**](http://handsdownlayout.com) on small portable boards.  Thanks!

**Warning:** This repository is quite messy, as I copied much over, tried to simplify things down to make it more understandable （I'm very new to ZMK), and stopped cleaning up partway. I have only remapped the vf keymap and required extra filesfor 30 keys. The rest still are set up for 34.
