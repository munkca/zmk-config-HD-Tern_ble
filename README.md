My personal ZMK take on [**Hands Down**](http://handsdownlayout.com) on small portable boards.

### Definitions exist for:
- [***Promethium***](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1g66ivi/hands_down_promethium_snth_meets_hd_silverengram/) (*Alan's "bottom heavy" mod*)
- [***Rhodium***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.bv3bay1cp21z)
- [***Titanium***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.wc98dpulr54c)
- [***Vibranium***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.eyvjpfoqjy65) (mods *Vf, Vb, Vx, Vv*)
 
In the works (*I test the builds on several boards, with adaptives & combos*):
- [***Neu***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.ze4kq734zl5w)
- [***Gold***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu#h.8i2msuo3butx)

**Nearly everything is working**:
 - Many combos for less-used letters (`Qu`,`Z`,) editing (`Undo`, `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste`, `Tab`, etc.), symbols and punctuation (`@`,`!`,`?`,`;`,`:`,`=` etc.).
 - **`H` digraph combos** *(* `TH`,`CH`,`WH`,`SH`,`GH`,`PH` *bigrams*), and pronouns (`I `, `I've `, `you'll`, `we'd`, etc. ).
 - [***Adaptive Keys***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.ps4itorhjiq9) are now using urob's slick [behavior-adaptive-key](https://github.com/urob/zmk-adaptive-key/) module to further improve an already great layout (*removing more SFBs, scissors, etc.*), 
 - [***Comma-cap***](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1cc2yri/oneshot_shift_via_adaptive_keys/) is very snappy using Adaptive Keys. Comma immediately before a letter will capitalize it (deleting the comma). Linger/Hold on comma for CapsLk, Double-tap comma for CAPS_WORD. It's nearly perfect, and greatly reduces the need for home row shift (eliminating the most pesky HRM issue). It doesn't require a dedicated key for all this–It just works by exploiting a well-established pattern in how a comma is used, never immediatly preceding a letter.
 - [***Linger Keys***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.w8doktr0rzce) (*via hold-tap behaviors and macros*) for things like paired symbols like `{([<>])}` and diacritics `éèôåō`, and more.

Currently building only for Mac only (*hard coded for gui instead of ctrl, and some Mac specific keycodes*), because I use this mainly with my iPads and phone when I'm on the road. My [***Semantic Keys***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.7mehnxbqcx2s) feature for platform independence works on my QMK implementations, but isn't yet fully fleshed out and will require more invasive work for ZMK, so this is for later. *I'll probably deal with this with a separate platform layer and macro parameters…this will take time. I'm stupid busy currently.*

### Templates for many popular keyboards & form-factors:

## Thanks:
- Of course, huge thanks to [**Pete Johanson**](https://github.com/petejohanson) *and contributors* for ZMK ([***why not consider sponsoring Pete***](https://github.com/sponsors/petejohanson)?)
- and for the exquisite [Zaphod](https://github.com/petejohanson/zaphod-config) board design.
- [urob](https://github.com/urob/) for the excellent [behavior-adaptive-key](https://github.com/urob/zmk-adaptive-key/) module.
- [jcmkk3](https://github.com/jcmkk3) for the idea to implement adaptives via sticky layers that worked until proper solutions were made.
- many others on the [**Hands Down** Discord](https://discord.gg/BC3fzb2E) for the endless creativity and support.
- [Darryldh (lowprokb)](https://github.com/LOWPROKB) for the sublime [Corne-ish Zen](https://github.com/LOWPROKB/zmk-config-Corne-ish-Zen) board.
- Also thanks to [caksoylar](https://github.com/caksoylar)/Bravekarma on the [ZMK Discord](https://discord.gg/HXWA39qJKX) for the great keymap visualization tool, [keymap drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) used to make the keymap images below, and a lot of help with some implementations (*consider sponsoring them, too, for all their work maturing ZMK*?). And for other individual help.
