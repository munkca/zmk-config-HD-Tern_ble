Keymap based on Moutis's adapted ZMK take on [**Hands Down**](http://handsdownlayout.com) on small portable boards.  Thanks!

Thanks also to Jorge Villalobos, who has a great keymap-drawer [**configuration**](https://github.com/minusfive/knucklehead), which helped me to clean mine up.

And thanks to Cem Aksoylar for his amazing [**keymap-drawer!**](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) What a labour-saver!

**Warning:** This repository is quite messy, as I copied much over, tried to simplify things down to make it more understandable（I'm very new to ZMK), and is still a work in progress. I have only remapped the vf keymap and required extra files for 30 keys. The rest still are set up for 34.
