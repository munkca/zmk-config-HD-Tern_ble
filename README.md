 <sup>[1]</sup> Requires split keyboard with at least 2 thumb keys per side. <br>
 <sup>[2]</sup> **H-digraph combos** (`TH`,`CH`,`WH`,`SH`,`GH`,`PH` bigrams) are expected in the design of this layout. It can be used without the H-digraph combos, but that would add more burden to the H-pinky. Layouts not designed expecting the H-digraphs can still work with them, and they are defined in the configuration files. <br>
 <sup>[3]</sup> [*Adaptive Keys*](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.ps4itorhjiq9) are recommended to further improve an already great layout (*removing more SFBs, scissors, etc.*). `WM` becomes `LM`, `GM`/`MG` -> `GL`/`LG` (\**Magic* keys are a type of Adaptive, restricted to one key. I have, effectivey, many \**Magic* keys at strategic locations around the keyboard.) Adaptives use urob's slick [behavior-adaptive-key](https://github.com/urob/zmk-adaptive-key/) module.<br>
 <sup>[4]</sup> *Vim Friendly* variations were designed with VIM in mind, especially the navigation letters. Other layouts can work with VIM, especially with a separate nav layer.<br>

 - Many combos for less-used letters (`Qu`,`Z`,) editing (`Undo`, `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste`, `Tab`, etc.), symbols and punctuation (`@`,`!`,`?`,`;`,`:`,`=` etc.).
 - [***Comma Magic***](https://github.com/moutis/zmk-config/blob/9628259185a4271353cf477db80fd703a6a2eb51/config/moutis/moutis_behaviors.dtsi#L403C1-L442C1) is very snappy use of Adaptive Keys to eliminate the shift misfires common with home row mods. Simply type `COMMA` immediately before an alpha to capitalize it (*deleting the comma*). Linger/Hold on comma for CapsLk, Double-tap comma for CAPS_WORD. It doesn't require a dedicated key for all this; it just works by exploiting a well-established pattern in how a comma is used, never immediatly preceding a letter, and never repeated. It works nearly flawlessly for me.

 - [***Linger Keys***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.w8doktr0rzce) (*via hold-tap behaviors and macros*) for things like paired symbols like `{([<>])}` and diacritics `éèôåō`, and more.

Currently building only for Mac only (*hard coded for gui instead of ctrl, and some Mac specific keycodes*), because I use this mainly with my iPads and phone when I'm on the road. My [***Semantic Keys***](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown#h.7mehnxbqcx2s) feature for platform independence works on my QMK implementations, but isn't yet fully fleshed out and will require more invasive work for ZMK, so this is for later. *I'll probably deal with this with a separate platform layer and macro parameters…this will take time. I'm stupid busy currently.*

- and for the exquisite [Zaphod](https://github.com/petejohanson/zaphod-config) board design.
- [urob](https://github.com/urob/) for the excellent [behavior-adaptive-key](https://github.com/urob/zmk-adaptive-key/) module.
- [jcmkk3](https://github.com/jcmkk3) for the idea to implement adaptives via sticky layers that worked until proper solutions were made.
- many others on the [**Hands Down** Discord](https://discord.gg/BC3fzb2E) for the endless creativity and support.
- [Darryldh (lowprokb)](https://github.com/LOWPROKB) for the sublime [Corne-ish Zen](https://github.com/LOWPROKB/zmk-config-Corne-ish-Zen) board.
- Also thanks to [caksoylar](https://github.com/caksoylar)/Bravekarma on the [ZMK Discord](https://discord.gg/HXWA39qJKX) for the great keymap visualization tool, [keymap drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) used to make the keymap images below, and a lot of help with some implementations (*consider sponsoring them, too, for all their work maturing ZMK*?). And for other individual help.
